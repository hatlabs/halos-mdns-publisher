# /etc/mdns.allow - Configure which domains nss-mdns resolves
# Installed by halos-mdns-publisher to enable multi-label mDNS resolution
#
# By default, nss-mdns only resolves single-label .local names (e.g., hostname.local).
# This configuration enables resolution of multi-label names like auth.hostname.local,
# which are used by HaLOS container subdomains.
#
# See nss-mdns(5) for more information.

# Allow all .local domain names (including multi-label like auth.hostname.local)
.local.
.local
